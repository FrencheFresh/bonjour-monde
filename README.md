Hi, my name is Max. This is really my first time doing anything coding wise. I have hopes, and no doubts of the troubles it will bring me. I'm excited to conquer this challenge. My goals with this is to develop fluidity in my coding, and to learn Python. Maybe I can make a career out of this. Who knows? The work will be tough & tedious. Through discipline, and will power, I believe I can do it. A little bit about myself? Just some dude, looking for a challenge.
